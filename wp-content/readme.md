Clone the project to your local machine

cd to your project directory (this is master branch)

before developing switch branch to your own branch 
EX: branch name : jonh
- git checkout -b jonh

To check which branch you are in : git branch

Now you are ready to develop

when you make changes in your local code, please push the code to your worked branch in order to avoid conflict
> git push origin "branch name"

after that you can make pull request to master branch to merge the code together
